# Overview

In an age where organizations are becoming more and more "data-driven", exposing services & microservices via APIs is becoming the norm. These APIs are consumed by a wide range of devices for various day to day activities such as banking, shopping, smart solutions etc. In the recent past, the number of consumers, consuming these APIs have increased exponentially. This brings in new challenges for enterprises to deal with such as security of services,  maintaining APIs, managing APIs, enforcing policies etc. This is where an API Management solution is required. An API management solution manages the APIs by taking care of the exposure related complexities such as security, rate limiting, monitoring etc, while providing a platform to manage the APIs .

**The WSO2 API Manager is a high performant API Management solution** designed to solve this problem elegantly. It is the **only 100% open source** solution and comes with an [Apache Software License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) which makes it **free to use** .
